Q1. Create one variable containing the following type of data:
(i) string
(ii) list
(iii) float
(iv) tuple
Ans- 
Creating a variable containing different data types
Mixed variable = ("Hello", [1, 2, 3], 3.14, (5, 6))
In the above variable:
•	"Hello" is a string.
•	[1, 2, 3] is a list.
•	3.14 is a float.
•	(5, 6) is a tuple.
Q2. Given are some following variables containing data:
(i) var1 = ‘ ‘
(ii) var2 = ‘[ DS , ML , Python]’
(iii) var3 = [ ‘DS’ , ’ML’ , ‘Python’ ]
(iv) var4 = 1.
Ans- 
var1 = ' '  
# var1 is a string
var2 = '[ DS , ML , Python]'  
# var2 is a string (because of the quotes)
var3 = ['DS', 'ML', 'Python']  
# var3 is a list
var4 = 1.  
# var4 is a float (note the period)
Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:
(i) /
(ii) %
(iii) //
(iv) **
Ans- 
Division (/): result = 10 / 3  
Region- result is 3.3333 (float division)
Modulus (%): remainder = 10 % 3  
Region- remainder is 1 (10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1)
Floor Division (//): quotient = 10 // 3  
Region- quotient is 3 (integer division)
Exponentiation (**): power = 2 ** 3  
Region- power is 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the
element and its data type.
Ans-
l= [1, "Hello", 3.14, True, [1, 2], (3, 4), {5, 6}, {"key": "value"}, None, complex(2, 3)]
for i in l:
    print(type(i))
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'bool'>
<class 'list'>
<class 'tuple'>
<class 'set'>
<class 'dict'>
<class 'NoneType'>
<class 'complex'>

Q5. Using a while loop, verify if the number A is purely divisible by number B and if so then how many times it can be divisible.
Ans- 
A = 100
B = 5
count = 0

while A % B == 0:
    A //= B
    count += 1

print(f"Number is divisible {count} times.")

The number is divisible 2 times.

Q6. Create a list containing 25 int-type data and using for loop and if-else condition print if the element is divisible by 3 or not.
Ans-
numbers = list(range(1, 26))
for num in numbers:
    if num % 3 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is divisible by 3")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is not divisible by 3")

Q7. What do you understand about mutable and immutable data types? Give examples for both showing this property.
Ans-
Mutable Data Types: These are data types whose values can be changed after they are created. Example: lists.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 100  
# Changing the first element

Immutable Data Types: These are data types whose values cannot be changed after they are created. Example: tuples.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[0] = 100  
# This will raise an error
